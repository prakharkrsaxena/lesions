Naive Keras is used to build CNN and Transfer learning is used to create this model which simply means that a pretrained network is used and then layers are added to it. 
For training,Adam optimizer and the Categorical Cross Entropy loss function is used.
The model achieves about 85% accuracy with HAM dataset.
